Docker performance can be limited on Mac, mostly due to the fact that Docker runs in a minimal VM
which has limited hardware resource by default. That can be changed by going to:

Docker > Preferences > Advanced

and allowing it access to more CPU and RAM resource.

There are a few other areas that can be improved, see: https://markshust.com/2018/01/30/performance-tuning-docker-mac
